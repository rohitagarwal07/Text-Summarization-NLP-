Summarization can be defined as a task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information and overall meaning. One benefit of this will be, you don’t need to train and build a model prior start using it for your project. It’s good to understand Cosine similarity to make the best use of the code you are going to see. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. Its measures cosine of the angle between vectors. The angle will be 0 if sentences are similar.\"\n",
